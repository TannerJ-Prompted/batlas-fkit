The core concept is to do away with the math and libraries of rules and focus on common archetypes to determine outcomes. Instead of a list of modifiers, additions, subtractions, and niche rules, Batlas asks 'Would a knight be good at this?' and uses a simple dice system to grant bonuses or penalties based on the answer. Those seeking a game with many rules and stat maximasition should look elsewhere. Those seeking a game where they can play a character and not a set of numbers will find endless dungeons of fun waiting for them in the Batlas."
